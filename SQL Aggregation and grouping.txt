Problem Statement:
-----------------
Select all data from the games table.

As you can see, this table consists of the following columns:

id – the id of a given game,
title – the title of a given game,
company – the name of a company that produced a given game,
type – the genre of a given game,
production_year – the year in which a game was created,
system – the system for which a game was released,
production_cost – the cost of producing of a given game,
revenue – the revenue a given game generated,
rating – the rating of a given game.

---1.Select all data from the games table and order the results by the cost of the production from the cheapest to the most expensive. If the cost of production is the same, order by ratings from best to worst.
--SELECT * FROM games
   ORDER BY production_cost ASC, rating DESC;

---2.Show the average production cost of games that were produced between 2010 and 2015 and were rated higher than 7.
--SELECT AVG(production_cost) FROM games
    WHERE (production_year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015)
     AND rating > 7;

---3.What was the total revenue for all shooter games that were created after 2010 and rated higher than 3?
--SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM games
   WHERE type LIKE 'shooter' 
     AND production_year > 2010 
     AND rating > 3;

---4.Count how many games were released each year, what was the average cost of production and what was their average revenue.
--SELECT production_year, COUNT(id), AVG(production_cost), AVG(revenue) FROM games
    GROUP BY production_year;

---5.Count how many games of a given type turned out to be profitable (their revenue was greater than the production cost). Show the number of games and the type column.
---SELECT COUNT(id), type FROM GAMES 
    WHERE revenue > production_cost 
     GROUP BY type;

---6.For all companies present in the table, show their name and the sum of gross profit over all years. 
To simplify this problem, assume that the gross profit is revenue - cost of production, show this column as sum. 
Show the results starting with the company that had the highest gross profit.
--SELECT company, SUM(revenue - production_cost) AS sum FROM games
   GROUP BY company
   ORDER BY sum;

---7.For each company, select its name, the number of games it produced, the average cost of production. Show only these companies that produced more than one game.
--SELECT company, COUNT(id), AVG(production_cost) FROM games
    GROUP BY company
    HAVING COUNT(id) > 1;

---8.We're interested in good games produced between 2000 and 2009. A good game is a game that got rating higher than 6 and was profitable. 
For each company show company name, its total revenue from good games produced between 2000 and 2009, 
and the number of good games it produced in this period. Only show companies with good-game revenue over 4 000 000.
--SELECT company, SUM(revenue), count(id) FROM games
   WHERE (production_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2009) AND rating > 6 AND (revenue > production_cost)
   GROUP BY company
   HAVING SUM(revenue) > 4000000;
